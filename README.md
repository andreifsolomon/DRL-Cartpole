# DRL-Cartpole
A DQN solution implementation for OPENAI GYM Enduro (https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0)


## Description
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's velocity.

This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson
